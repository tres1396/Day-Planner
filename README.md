# Day Planner Application

This application is a day planner that allows you to set your schedule. You can input daily tasks into each hour and save them to local storage so that they reload when you navigate away, or refresh the browser. Each time block changes color based on the time of day. Gray for the past, red for the current hour, and green for the future.
